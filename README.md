# Machine Learning (numpy only algorithms)

## Clone and Install Dependencies

```shell
git clone https://github.com/spandananupam/machine-learning
```
```shell
cd machine-learning && python -m pip install requirements.txt
```
Then you can just run your required code, or edit.

## Dependencies

This project has the following dependencies:
* Numpy (Math functions)
* Matplotlib Pyplot (Plotting cost and displaying images)
* TensorFlow Keras (Datasets, like MNIST and Fashion MNIST)

## Contents

### This contains code for:
* Deep L layered neural network (naturally, the code for autoencoders and similar too)
* Convolutional neural network preprocessing (using the `feed_forward.py` code)

### Structure:
This set will contain code that depend on each other. For example, codes that require a feedforward network anywhere will import `feedforward.py`. 

### To do:
* Recurrent neural network
* Graph neural network

#### Maintainers:
Spandan Anupam (Integrated MSc), Rucha Bhalchandra Joshi (PhD), as part of a project work under Prof. Subhankar Mishra, NISER.
